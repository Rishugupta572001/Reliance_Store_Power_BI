# Reliance Sales Report
## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive sales analysis report for Reliance, created using Power BI. The main objective of this project was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights to support strategic decision-making. The report includes data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, and an interactive dashboard for visualization.

## Project Objective

- Analyze Relianceâ€™s sales data to generate key insights.
- Build a dynamic, interactive dashboard showcasing essential metrics.
- Apply data analysis techniques to create meaningful visualizations.

## Project Objective
 1.  _**Data Cleaning with Power Query**_
 * Used Power Query for data transformation following the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
 * Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, standardized data formats, and optimized data for analysis.
 2.  _**Data Modeling**_
 * Created a data model to define relationships between different tables.
 * Established relationships to enhance query performance and allow efficient filtering and slicing of data within the report.
  3.  _**DAX Calculations**_
 * Implemented DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas for custom measures, such as total sales, year-over-year growth, and other key performance indicators.
 * These measures allowed more insightful analysis of trends and patterns.
  4.  _**Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation**_
 * Built an interactive dashboard including key metrics, charts, and filters.
 * Used various visual elements to make insights clear and enable dynamic data exploration.
## Key Features
